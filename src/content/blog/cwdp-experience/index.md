I started my CWDP studies right after I passed my Cisco 300-425 Exam, my goal was obtaining the CWDP cert before 2020 ends, it took me 3 months to prepare and pass the exam, starting from 9-16 to 12-15.

I set my expectations to go to the test center in mid-December, giving me some time to retake the exam before the holidays if it’s required.

Fortunately, and we good preparation I did pass the exam on the first attempt, a rule of thumb; always follow the best practices when you are designing a WLAN, that’s all.

## What it takes to become a CWDP certified

The CWDP certification is a professional level wireless LAN certification for the CWNP Program. To earn a CWDP certification, you must hold a current and valid CWNA credential. You must take the CWDP exam at a Pearson Vue Testing Center and pass with a 70% or higher. Instructors must pass with an 80% or higher. However you choose to prepare for the CWDP exam, you should start with the exam objectives, which cover the full list of skills tested on the exam. The CWDP certification is valid for three (3) years. To recertify, you must have a current CWNA credential and pass the current CWDP exam. By passing the CWDP certificate, your CWNA certificate will be renewed for another three years.

## CWDP Materials

The only source of the study that I used was [CWDP-303 Official Study Guide](https://www.cwnp.com/cwdp303sg/), everything needed to succeed in the exam is on there.

## Exam day

12-15-2020,

In general, it was a good experience regarding the Pearson Vue delivery software, fortunately, I didn’t face tricky questions, the majority of the questions were well-formulated and direct to the point, basically, I faced at least 2 questions regarding the exam objectives [here](https://www.cwnp.com/uploads/cwdp-303-objectives-2018.pdf).

Only multiple choice questions, there are no simulation labs on the exam, very important you have the option to go back after answering any question, and before ending the exam, there is a button to review the unanswered questions or all the questions.

## Results

My test score was 93/100. Sadly enough, the test tenter had some technical issues, and they couldn’t print the score report at that moment.

The advice from the test center was; If you do not have a CWNP score report, please contact the Pearson VUE exam delivery center where you took your exam to request the score report.

On my CWNP account, I can see results based on well-answered questions as follow:

Besides that, nothing compares to the feeling of meeting the goals successfully, I think, I had some advantage due to my previous Cisco Wireless Desing exam preparation [(link to the post)](https://www.dar-fi.com/enwlsd-exam-experience/) because I invested a lot of time learning for that Certification, I read every corner of the blueprint exam, and I always found myself looking into somebody’s blog or diving on the cisco community to figure it out something.

The first time reading the CWDP Official Cert Guide, I felt; heeey I’ve been here before, for me was easy to grasp and reinforce all the concepts, it was like reviewing old topics and getting the subjects from the CWDP standard perspective.

As always, I hope that my short experience can answer any doubt during your CWDP journey, please stay safe, and protect yourself and others from Coronavirus (COVID-19)
