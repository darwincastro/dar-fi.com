This post describes how to set up a Meraki WLAN with 802.1x using EAP-TLS as an Authentication Method.

If you want to get some background about the flow process of EAP-TLS, please take a look at my previous <a href="./eap-tls-auth" target="_blank">post</a>, along with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5216" target="_blank">RFC 5216</a> page.

## Components Used

- Windows 10 Workstation (Wireless Supplicant)
- Meraki MR52 (Authenticator)
- Cisco ISE (Authentication Server)
- Windows Server 2016 (Certificate Authority)
- Some L2/L3 Network devices help with end-to-end communication.

## Topology Implemented

![topology implemented](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_01.png)

You can use other alternatives or combinations of the components above mentioned, but for this demo, I will play around with the above topology, we expected to have complete reachability between the Authenticator, Authentication Server, and Certificate Authority Server to get the wireless authentication using EAP-TLS.

## Configure

I will mainly focus on the Authenticator, and the Authentication Server side, however, I’m going to scope some supplicant and CA configurations as well.

### Let’s start with the Authenticator = Meraki Side

Step 1:

The first step is to configure an SSID in the Meraki Dashboard, in the desired Meraki Network go to:

<Path
  route={[
    'Wireless',
    'SSIDs',
    'Select any SSID at your convenience',
    'Select enabled',
    'Rename the SSID',
    'Save the changes',
  ]}
/>

as shown in the image.

After saving, click on **edit settings.**

Step 2:

Under **Access Control (select the SSID)**

- Association requirements: Enterprise with my RADIUS server as shown in the image.

![continue with the eap configuration](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_03.png)

- Splash page None (direct access)
- RADIUS servers (Here, you need to enter the IP address and the shared secret that is used to validate the MR52 on the ISE side.
- Optionally, you can enable RADIUS CoA, and you can set the RADIUS Accounting (I’m just leaving the default values) as shown in the image.

![configuring ise](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_04.png)

- The client IP assignment (It’s up to you, you can use Bridge mode with or without VLAN tagging, or simply use NAT mode for simplicity as shown in the image.

![configuring the Meraki dashboard](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_05.png)

- I’m leaving the rest of the options per Meraki default as shown in the image.

![Meraki default options](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_06.png)

Step 3:

It is a good idea to verify that you can reach the RADIUS server from the MR52 before you continue, go to **Wireless > Access Points > Select the access point > Tools > Ping using the RADIUS IP address.**

Now, the Authenticator side is done!

### RADIUS server (ISE configuration)

![Radius with ISE configuration](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_07.png)

Step 1:

Go to **Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Authentication > Allowed Protocols** and click **Add.**

- On this Allowed Protocol list, you can enter the name for the list. In this case, **Allow EAP-TLS** box is checked and other boxes are unchecked as shown in the image.

![configuring ISE protocols ](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_08.png)

Step 2:

Go to: **Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices > Add** as shown in the image.

![configuring resources](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_09.png)

Step 3: Create New User on ISE

Go to **Administration > Identity Management > Identities > Users > Add** as shown in the image.

![configuring identities](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_10.png)

![configuring identities v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_11.png)

Step 4. Create Policy set

Go to **Policy > Policy Set** and then click on the plus (**+**) icon in the upper-left corner as shown in the image.

![configuring policy set ISE](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_12.png)

Step 5: Set the policy name (it could be something generic)

Under the conditions menu, select “Network Access Protocol > EQUALS RADIUS”, and lastly, select the name of the policy result set in step 1 as shown in the image.

![configuring policy set ISE v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_13.png)

Step 6: Create an Authentication Policy.

Go to the **>** icon on the body's right side as shown in the image.

![configuring policy set authentication](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_14.png)

Step 7:

Go to Authentication Policy > click on the plus (**+**) icon, and set “the conditions & use” as shown in the image.

![configuring policy set authentication v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_15.png)

Step 8:

Go to Authorization Policy > click on the plus (**+**) icon, and set “the conditions & results profiles” as shown in the image.

![configuring policy set authorization](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_16.png)

Step 9: Verify

![configuring policy set authorization v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_17.png)

Step 10: Certificate on ISE

Go to **Administration > Certificates > Certificate Signing Requests > Generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)** as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_18.png)

Step 11:

As shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_19.png)

The result:

![ISE generate certificate v3](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_20.png)

Step 12:

**Select the certificated generated > View > CSR Contents > Copy** (from “Begin to End”) as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v4](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_21.png)

Step 13:

From here is necessary to go into the **Windows Server** (Certificate Authority) > **open a web browser** and **Request a Certificate** to complete the ISE configurations as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v5](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_22.png)

Step 14:

Click **Advanced certificate request** as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v6](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_23.png)

Step 15:

Click **Submit a certificate request by using a base-64….**  as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v7](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_24.png)

Step 16:

Paste the CSR generated on step 12 in the **Base-64 encoded certificate request**. From the **Certificate Template:** drop-down option, choose **Web Server** and click **Submit** as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v8](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_25.png)

Step 17:

Once you click **Submit**, you get the option to select the type of certificate, select **Base-64 encoded,** and click **Download certificate chain** as shown in the image.

![ISE generate certificate v9](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_26.png)

Step 18:

Going back to the ISE server

Extract the certificates, the main file will contain two certificates, one root certificate, and another intermediate. The root certificate can be imported under **Administration > Certificates > Trusted certificates > Import** as shown in the images.

![ISE import signed certs](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_27.png)

Once you click **Submit**, the certificate is added to the trusted certificate list.

Step 19:

Go to **Administration > Certificates > Certificate Signing Requests > Bind Certificate** and add the intermediate certificate as shown in the image.

![ISE bind certificate](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_28.png)

Step 20:

To view the certificate, navigate to **Administration > Certificates > System Certificates** as shown in the image.

### Windows Workstation (Supplicant)

To authenticate a wireless user through EAP-TLS, you have to generate a client certificate.

Step 1:

Go to the CA and **create** a **user** using the same credentials used in the RADIUS server (ISE configuration) step 3.

![CA user creation](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_30.png)

For this lab, I’m creating a matching user on both sides (ISE & CA) you can integrate an AD or LDAP to your ISE server and reference it under the policy set authentication as well.

Step 2:

Connect your Windows computer to the network so that you can access the server. Open a web browser and enter this: `https://severIPaddress/certsrv`

The credential belongs to the recent **user created** on the CA & ISE.

![login on CA](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_31.png)

---

**Important**:

It should be noted that the CA must be the same with which the certificate was downloaded for ISE.

---

Step 3:

Click **Request a certificate** as previously done, however this time you need to select **User** as the Certificate Template as shown in the image.

![CA request certificate](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_32.png)

Step 4:

Click **User Certificate** as shown in the image.

![login on CA](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_33.png)

Step 5:

Certificate Template > **User > Create new key set > Key size 1024 > Automatic key container name > Mark key as exportable > CMC > sha1 > Submit** as shown in the image.

![](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_34.png)

Step 6:

Click **Install this certificate** to install the certificate in the local machine.

![install the certificate on user's windows computer](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_35.png)

Step 7:

Go **Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Setup a new connection or network** > Select **Manually connect to a wireless network > Next** as shown in the image.

![install the certificate on user's windows computer v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_36.png)

Step 8:

**Network name** (This name must match with the SSID in **The Authenticator = Meraki Side** Step 1) > **Security type: Select WPA2-Enterprise > Next.**

![wireless profile creation on windows](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_37.png)

Step 9:

Click **Change connection settings.**

![wireless profile creation on windows v2](/configure-eap-tls-using-ise-and-meraki-ap/image_38.png)
