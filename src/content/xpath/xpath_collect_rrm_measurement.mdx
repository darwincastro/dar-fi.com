RRM enables Cisco WLCs to continually monitor their associated lightweight access points for the following information:

-   Traffic load: The total bandwidth used for transmitting and receiving traffic. It enables wireless LAN managers to track and plan network growth ahead of client demand.
    
-   Interference: The amount of traffic coming from other 802.11 sources.
    
-   Noise: The amount of non-802.11 traffic that is interfering with the currently assigned channel.
    
-   Coverage: The received signal strength (RSSI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all connected clients.
    
-   Other: The number of nearby access points.

## Example:

### GET

```json
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://10.93.178.145:8480/restconf/proxy/https://10.93.178.70:443/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-wireless-rrm-oper:rrm-oper-data/rrm-measurement' \
  -H 'accept: application/yang-data+json'
```


### Sending

```json
http://10.93.178.145:8480/restconf/proxy/https://10.93.178.70:443/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-wireless-rrm-oper:rrm-oper-data/rrm-measurement
```

The following is just a fragment of the WLC response

```json
